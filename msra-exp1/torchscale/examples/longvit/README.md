# [(LongViT) When an Image is Worth 1,024 x 1,024 Words: A Case Study in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03558)

**LongViT** is a vision Transformer that can process gigapixel images (e.g., 32,768x32,768 images) in an end-to-end manner. We split the image into millions of patches and employ [LongNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02486) to directly model the extremely long sequence. We apply LongViT in the field of computational pathology and achieve remarkable performance on cancer subtyping and survival prediction tasks.


## Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/shumingma/fairseq.git@moe
pip install -v -U git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers.git@v0.0.20#egg=xformers
```


## Pretraining

We perform self-supervised pretraining on TCGA diagnostic slides using [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294) objective. The detailed instructions can be found at [`get_started_for_tcga_pretraining.md`](get_started/get_started_for_tcga_pretraining.md).

## Fine-tuning on Subtyping Classification

We perform finetuning on cancer subtyping on images with sizes up to 32,768x32,768 (1M patches). The detailed instructions can be found at [`get_started_for_tcga_subtyping.md`](get_started/get_started_for_tcga_subtyping.md).


## Fine-tuning on Survival Prediction

We perform finetuning on survival prediction on images with sizes up to 32,768x32,768 (1M patches). The detailed instructions can be found at [`get_started_for_tcga_survival_prediction.md`](get_started/get_started_for_tcga_survival_prediction.md).
